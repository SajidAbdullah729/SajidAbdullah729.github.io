# Images Fixed! ✅

The assets have been copied to the `public` folder. Your images should now be visible.

## What was done:
- Created `public` folder
- Copied all assets from `assets/` to `public/assets/`

## If images still don't show:

1. **Restart the dev server** (if it was running):
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache** or do a hard refresh:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

3. **Check the browser console** for any 404 errors

4. **Verify the structure** - you should have:
   ```
   public/
   └── assets/
       ├── img/
       │   ├── image.jpg
       │   ├── image2.jpg
       │   └── imageback.jpg
       └── projects/
           ├── alaska/
           ├── carmania/
           ├── medimart/
           └── nextgen/
   ```

## Image paths in code:
All images use paths like `/assets/img/image.jpg` which is correct for Next.js public folder.

The images should now work! 🎉
